// Given an array add all the number elements and return the binary equivalent of that sum; to make the code bullet proof anything else than a number should be addeded as 0 since it can't be addeded.

// If your language can handle float binaries assume the array won't contain float or doubles.

// arr2bin([1,2]) == '11'
// arr2bin([1,2,'a']) == '11'
// arr2bin([]) == '0'

// NOTE: NaN is a number too in javascript for decimal, binary and n-ary base
// This is a modification on the Kata: Array2Binary addition hope you like it in js

const arr2bin = arr => arr.filter(x => typeof x == 'number').reduce((x, y) => x + y, 0).toString(2);
